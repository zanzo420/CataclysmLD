bullets range from str 1-20 based on mass and the velocity they travel at.
guns are parts that are put together and give the bullets possible bonuses when they are fired
weapons range from tiers 1 to 8

there will base a base type of rifle, pistol, shotgun, and smg.
differences
-pistols can have a barrel attachments, a laser attachment, and different clip lengths.
-smg the same.
-rifles too and can change stocks
-shotguns can change stocks and have the barrel cut off.
-clips will be a special container that can only hold bullets. you must reload clips with bullets and then load them into a weapon.

# since hits are calculated per body part the max armor value a player can have is 16
# tier 8 armor is the highest value and you can have two of them.

# chance to hit with weapons is determined by DEX, creature size, distance,

# difficulty = distance + (10/creature_size)
# chance to hit = 1d20 + ((DEX-10) + weapon_skill + marksmanship or melee skill)/3)
# 1d20 + 2 or 3-22 or 25% chance to hit on difficulty 15

# damage is calculated from the player's STR if melee or the bullet's strength if ranged.
# total armor value of the Bodypart hit minus strength of the hit.
# Tier of weapon + STR - armor_value
# 1-7 damage, light wound
# 8+ damage, heavy wound
# crits on 20, double damage

# STR 20 bullet w/ tier 8 weapon vs no armor = max damage possible

# for every 5 light wounds a creature has it lowers their DEX and STR and CON by 1
# each heavy wound lowers DEX and STR and CON by 1
# two heavy wounds on a single body part will incapacitate it. (two heavy wounds on a leg means you walk half speed.)
# a heavy wounds on a vital organ kills you.
# once your constitution reaches zero you die.
